CHAPTER 4

GLOBALISATION
AND THE INDIAN ECONOMY

As consumers in today’s world, some
of us have a wide choice of goods and
services before us. The latest models
of digital cameras, mobile phones and
televisions made by the leading
manufacturers of the world are within
our reach. Every season, new models
of automobiles can be seen on Indian
roads. Gone are the days when
Ambassador and Fiat were the only
cars on  Indian roads. Today, Indians
are buying cars produced by nearly
all the top companies in the world. A
similar explosion of brands can be
seen for many other goods: from shirts
to televisions to processed fruit juices.

Such wide-ranging choice of goods
in our markets is a relatively recent
phenomenon. You wouldn’t have
found such a wide variety of goods in
Indian markets even two decades
back. In a matter of years, our
markets have been transformed!

How do we understand these
rapid transformations? What are the
factors that are bringing about these
changes? And, how are these changes
affecting the lives of the people?
We shall dwell on these questions in
this chapter.

A large MNC, producing industrial equipment, designs its
products in research centres in the United States, and then
has the components manufactured in China. These are then
shipped to Mexico and Eastern Europe where the products
are assembled and the finished products are sold all over the
world. Meanwhile, the company’s customer care is carried out
through call centres located in India.

But the most common route for
MNC investments is to buy up local
companies and then to expand
production. MNCs with huge wealth
can quite easily do so. To take an

smaller Indian companies such as
Parakh Foods. Parakh Foods had
built a large marketing network in
various parts of India, where its brand
was well-reputed. Also, Parakh Foods
had four oil refineries, whose control

and Chennai have closed their units.

Batteries, capacitors, plastics, toys, tyres, dairy products, and
vegetable oil are some examples of industries where the small
manufacturers have been hit hard due to competition. Several of
the units have shut down rendering many workers jobless. The
small and medium industries in India employ the largest number
of workers (11 crores) in the country, next only to agriculture.

LET’S WORK THESE OUT

1. What are the ways in which Ravi’s small production unit was affected by rising competition?

2. Should producers such as Ravi stop production because their cost of production is higher compared to
producers in other countries? What do you think?

3. Recent studies point out that small producers in India need three things to compete better in the market
(a) better roads, power, water, raw materials, marketing and information network (b) improvements and
modernisation of technology (c) timely availability of credit at reasonable interest rates.

l Can you explain how these three things would help Indian producers?

l Do you think MNCs will be interested in investing in these? Why?

l Do you think the government has a role in making these facilities available? Why?

l Can you think of any other step that the government could take? Discuss.

Competition and Uncertain Employment

 Globalisation and the pressure of competition have substantially changed the lives
of workers. Faced with growing competition, most employers these days prefer to
employ workers ‘flexibly’. This means that workers’ jobs are no longer secure.

Let us see how the workers in the garment export industry
in India are having to bear this pressure of competition.

Factory workers folding garments for export. Though globalisation has created opportunities for paid work for
women, the condition of employment shows that women are denied their fair share of benefits.

The conditions of work and the hardships of the workers described above
have become common to many industrial units and services in India. Most
workers, today, are employed in the unorganised sector. Moreover, increasingly
conditions of work in the organised sector have come to resemble the
unorganised sector. Workers in the organised sector such as Sushila no longer
get the protection and benefits that they enjoyed earlier.

LET’S WORK THESE OUT

1. In what ways has competition affected workers, Indian exporters and foreign MNCs
in the garment industry?

2. What can be done by each of the following so that the workers can get a fair share
of benefits brought by globalisation?

(a) government

(b) employers at the exporting factories

(c) MNCs

(d) workers.

3. One of the present debates in India is whether companies should have flexible
policies for employment. Based on what you have read in the chapter, summarise
the point of view of the employers and workers.
